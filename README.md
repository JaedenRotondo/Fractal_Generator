### Description of Program: 
This program allows users to input certain variables and create different types of fractals using Y fractals as well as polygonal spirals. 

##### Time required to run
- The depth chosen by the user greatly impacts the time required to create the fractal. From a scale of 1-10, a depth of 2 (last branch has a length of 2 units) will take approximately 10 seconds while a depth of 10 will create a image when given around one second

#### Flexibility between outputs
- The following are different varibales which can be chosen by the user 
    - Polygon spiral (with number of sides; colours; fading between two colours)
    - Y Tree (with supplementary angle; width; colour(s))
    - Depth: determine how long the last arm of the Y Tree should be (Scale 1-10)
    - Thickness: determine how thick the Y Tree lines are 
#### Modules used: 
- The images were rendered using the Python module Turtle
